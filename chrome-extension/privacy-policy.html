    <p>
      Your privacy is important to us. This privacy policy explains what data we
      collect and how we use it.
    </p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
      Our Chrome extension does not collect any personal data from users. We do
      not track, store, or share any information about your browsing activity.
    </p>

    <h2>Permissions</h2>
    <p>The extension requires certain permissions to function properly:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Access to AWS SAML sign-in page:</strong> This permission is
        necessary to modify the appearance and functionality of the AWS SAML
        sign-in page to improve your experience.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
    <p>
      Since we do not collect any personal data, there is no information to use
      or share. The permissions requested are solely for the purpose of
      enhancing the AWS SAML sign-in page.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
