# **AWS-SAML-Signin-Beautifier**  

✨ **A Tampermonkey script to improve the AWS SAML sign-in page by making role selection faster, enhancing UI readability, and adding colors for easier scanning.**  

## 🚀 **What This Script Does**

If your company manages **many AWS accounts**, selecting the right role from the AWS SAML login page (`https://signin.aws.amazon.com/saml`) can be frustrating.  
This script **removes friction** from the process by:  

✔ **Turning role radio buttons into submit buttons** 🏎 – No need to scroll down and click "Sign In"  
✔ **Making the design easier to scan** 👀 – Quickly find the right role  
✔ **Adding color coding for clarity** 🎨 – Visually differentiate accounts  

🔹 **Designed for users managing multiple AWS accounts!**

### **3️⃣ Done!**  

Now, whenever you visit `https://signin.aws.amazon.com/saml`, the script will **improve the role selection experience automatically**.

## 🛠 **How It Works**
